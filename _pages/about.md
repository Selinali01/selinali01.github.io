Hi! My name is Selina. I am currently a Masters student at `Cornell Tech`, pursuing my MEng in Computer Science. Previously, I graduated from the `University of Pennsylvania`, where I received my B.A. in Economics, and minors in Data Science and Statistics. I worked as a Quant Researcher at J.P. Morgan for a year before pursuing my masters. 
<br>

I am also a competitive golfer, representing
            <a href="https://www.hkga.com/gahkc-squad-juniors/hk-squad/mens-and-ladies-national-team/li-yuen-yuet-selina">Hong Kong </a> nationally for over a decade, and 
            captained the  <a href="https://pennathletics.com/sports/womens-golf/roster/selina-li/19872"> UPenn Women's Golf Team (NCAA Division I) </a>.
